Welcome to the Face Attendance System repository! This project implements an automated attendance management system utilizing face recognition technology. Built with Python and OpenCV, it provides an efficient and user-friendly solution for tracking attendance in educational and professional settings.

Project Overview
This repository contains the complete code and documentation for the Face Attendance System, which includes:

Face Recognition: The system uses advanced face recognition algorithms to identify individuals and mark their attendance automatically, eliminating the need for manual entry.

Real-Time Attendance Tracking: Attendance is recorded in real-time as individuals are recognized, ensuring accurate and up-to-date records.

User -Friendly Interface: A simple graphical user interface (GUI) allows users to easily navigate the system, register new users, and view attendance records.

Features
Face Registration: Users can register their faces by capturing multiple images, which are then used to train the recognition model.

Automatic Attendance Marking: Once the model is trained, the system can automatically mark attendance based on face recognition during class or meetings.

CSV Export: Attendance records are saved in CSV format for easy access and management.

Secure Access: The system includes a secure login feature for teachers or administrators to view attendance records.
